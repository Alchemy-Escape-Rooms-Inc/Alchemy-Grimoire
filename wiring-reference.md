## I2C Address Master Registry

**Complete mapping of all I2C addresses across the escape room:**

| Address | Chip Model | Device(s) | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| 0x01 | ALS31300 | Original_Cannon_Legacy | Hall effect angle sensor | Default address before programming |
| 0x29 | VL53L0X | Wireless-Motion-Sensor (ShipMotion1/2/3), LuminousShell (SeaShells) | Time-of-flight distance | Trigger on proximity |

| 0x61 | ALS31300 | Driftwood, hall-sensor-with-mqtt | Hall sensor 2 | Programmed address |
| 0x62 | ALS31300 | Driftwood, hall-sensor-with-mqtt | Hall sensor 3 | Programmed address |

- ALS31300 default address is 0x01; addresses 0x60–0x67 are programmed via I2C register writes
- PCA9685 is a 16-channel PWM driver; multiple units can coexist on same bus with different addresses (0x40–0x5F available)

## Voltage & Power Reference

**Logic level and power supply specifications:**

| Board/Chip | Logic Level | Power Supply | Notes | 5V Tolerant? |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------|--------------|
| ESP32 | 3.3V | 5V USB or 3.3V regulated | GPIO output is 3.3V | **NO** |
| ESP32-S3 | 3.3V | 5V USB or 3.3V regulated | GPIO output is 3.3V, more stable | **NO** |
| ESP8266 | 3.3V | 3.3V regulated (≥500mA) | GPIO NOT 5V tolerant | **NO** |
| Arduino Mega 2560 | 5V | 7–12V barrel, 5V USB, or 9V battery | 5V GPIO output | **YES** |
| Arduino Uno | 5V | 7–12V barrel, 5V USB, or 9V battery | 5V GPIO output | **YES** |
| Arduino Nano | 5V | 5V USB mini, 7–12V raw | 5V GPIO output | **YES** |
| Arduino R4 WiFi | 3.3V/5V mixed | 5V USB-C | Some pins 5V tolerant; check datasheet | **Partial** |
| PCA9685 | 3.3V/5V logic | 5V logic, external V+ for servos | Can operate at 3.3V or 5V logic | **N/A** |
| BTS7960 H-bridge | 3.3V/5V logic | Match controller, separate motor power | PWM input logic level must match controller | **Variable** |
| Cytron MD13S | 3.3V/5V logic | Match controller, separate motor power | Works with 3.3V or 5V logic inputs | **Variable** |

**⚠️ Critical Voltage Notes:**
- **ESP32/ESP32-S3 are NOT 5V tolerant.** Use voltage dividers or level shifters when interfacing with 5V Arduino output.
- **Level shifters required** for any 5V→3.3V signals (e.g., Arduino Mega relay outputs to ESP32 inputs).
- **Motor power is separate** from logic power; BTS7960/MD13S can drive high-current motors independently.

## BAC Controller Terminal Wiring

**For Shattic, Captain, Cove, Jungle BAC modules:**

| Terminal | Function | Type | Details |
|----------|----------|------|---------|
| Inputs 0–7 | Digital inputs | DIN | Active High default; JP1/JP2 configurable for channels 0–3 |
| Outputs 0–7 | Relay outputs | SPDT (Form-C) | 10A @ 125V AC rated; **recommend ≤2A @ 24V DC** |
| Power | 12V or 24V DC | DC supply | Jumper-selectable on board |
| Common | GND | Reference | Shared return for all signals |

**Terminal Block Pinout (typical):**
```
[Input 0] [Input 1] [Input 2] [Input 3] [Input 4] [Input 5] [Input 6] [Input 7]
[Output 0 NO] [Output 0 COM] [Output 1 NO] [Output 1 COM] ... [Output 7 NO] [Output 7 COM]
[12V/24V+] [GND]
```

**Configuration Notes:**
- **Low Side (default):** Relay coil grounded; output HIGH = relay energized
- **High Side:** Relay coil at +V; output HIGH = relay de-energized (less common)
- **Load Ratings:** 2A @ 24V DC is safe for most escape room solenoids; 10A is absolute max for short-term/motor loads

---

## Quick Troubleshooting Reference

### I2C Bus Diagnostics
- **No devices detected:** Check SDA/SCL voltages (should be ~3.3V or 5V with pull-ups), verify terminal resistors (typically 4.7kΩ)
- **Address conflict:** Use I2C scanner to map all active addresses; reprogram ALS31300 to avoid 0x29 overlap with VL53L0X
- **Intermittent communication:** Check for loose solder joints, verify pull-up resistors on shared bus, reduce bus speed if needed

### GPIO/Relay Issues
- **Relay not energizing:** Verify relay logic (Active HIGH vs. LOW), check power to relay coil, measure GPIO voltage (should match logic level)
- **Motor won't move:** Confirm DIR/PWM pins and logic, verify motor power supply is separate and adequate, test with PWM at 50% (e.g., 128/255)
- **LED not lighting:** Verify GPIO output level matches LED logic (3.3V for ESP32, 5V for Arduino), check for proper pull-up/pull-down configuration

### ESP32/Arduino Compatibility
- **Signal not received on 3.3V board from 5V Arduino:** Use 1kΩ + 2kΩ voltage divider (5V Arduino output → divider → 3.3V ESP input)
- **Bootloader not responding:** Hold BOOT button, power cycle, or use `esptool.py` with `--before=default_reset`

## Cable & Connector Recommendations

| Connection Type | Recommended | Gauge | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------|-------|-------|
| I2C (SDA/SCL) | Twisted pair, shielded | 22–24 AWG | Keep runs <10ft; use 4.7kΩ pull-ups per bus |
| GPIO digital signals | Single wire or twisted pair | 22–24 AWG | Shield if near high-current motor lines |
| Relay coil power | Separate twisted pair | 18–20 AWG | Use diodes across coil for EMI suppression |
| Motor power (H-bridge) | Heavy gauge | 16–18 AWG | Keep separate from logic lines; <6ft recommended |
| Servo signal | 3-pin servo connector | 22–24 AWG | PWM on dedicated pin; PCA9685 can drive 16 servos |
| Potentiometer | Twisted pair (3-wire) | 22–24 AWG | Shield center wire; connect GND and 3.3V/5V to outer pins |

## Safety Warnings & Best Practices

### Electrical Safety
- **Always disconnect power** before rewiring or troubleshooting
- **Use fused power supplies** for all 12V/24V circuits; 1–2A fuses typical
- **Never daisy-chain relay coils** without inline diodes (1N4148 or similar) to prevent back-EMF damage
- **Insulate all exposed contacts** on relay terminals; label high-voltage sections

### Motor Safety
- **Set PWM limits** (e.g., max 200/255) to prevent mechanical jam or excessive force
- **Test limit switches** before activation; confirm LOW signal when mechanical stop engaged
- **Use 120ms interlocks** between extend/retract commands (BarrelPiston reference) to prevent simultaneous coil energization
- **Monitor current draw** on H-bridge/motor controller; thermal shutdown typically at 80°C

### I2C & Sensor Safety
- **Verify I2C address uniqueness** before deploying multiple sensors on same bus (use I2C scanner tool)
- **Apply 4.7kΩ pull-ups** on each I2C bus (SDA and SCL); do not add pull-ups in parallel (causes excess current)
- **Shield long I2C runs** (>10ft) to reduce noise and capacitive coupling

### Firmware & Configuration
- **Back up current firmware** before flashing updates
- **Test new firmware on dev board** before deploying to production device
- **Document any custom pin mappings** in this reference after field modifications
